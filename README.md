The Search, Assess, and Rescue Robot (SARR) is an embedded systems project developed to aid emergency operations in disaster-struck or hazardous areas. Built using the ESP32 microcontroller and integrated with PIR sensors, a camera module, and Bluetooth/Wi-Fi communication, the robot can navigate confined spaces, detect human presence, and stream real-time video and sensor data for remote decision-making. Assembled on a motorized rover chassis and programmed in Arduino IDE, SARR demonstrates modular software, sensor interfacing, wireless data transmission, and basic decision-making. Future improvements include terrain adaptability, better video streaming, object detection using machine learning, and potential cleaning use-cases.
